## Description

This project was made to Share Jokes with other Users in a social media(-like) format.  
My main motivation was to be able to share funny and not-so-funny jokes with friends.  
So I built this project for that reason. to share these short jokes.  
This project solved my issue of knowing what jokes other people found funny.  
specifically I solved this issue with a Like and Dislike System.  
ultimately my takeaway from this project was that I don't want to write another line of PHP again
